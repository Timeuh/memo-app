Then simply run ```npm run dev``` to run the local server and see the result.

### 👨‍💻 Use the app
To use the app, just try and create memos using the form.

You will then see the list on the left fill with the created memo. 
On mobile, the list is visible when clicking on the menu button in the top left corner.

When clicking a memo from the list, you will be able to edit it,
and save it by clicking the save button of the form.

You can also delete a memo by selecting it and clicking the delete button.

The remaining button is to clear the form and begin creating a new memo.
